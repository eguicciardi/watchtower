# Watchtower
Watchtower is going to be an unopinionated little blog engine.

# Requirements

# Dependecies
Watchtower relies on a series of dependencies tidily packed in package.json:

* Morgan, HTTP request logger middleware for node.js - [Github Repository](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)

* Dotenv, an environment variuables loading module - [Github Repository](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) 

# Installation

# License
Watchtower is MIT-Licensed. It's not required at all but I'll really appreciate a mention to this repository or [https://guicciardi.net](my website).
